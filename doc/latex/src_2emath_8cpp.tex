\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the main source file for the mathematical equation operations. 

This file implements the functions declared in \mbox{\hyperlink{emath_8h}{emath.\+h}}.~\newline
It consists of two classes, the Monomial class and the Polynomial class.~\newline
The Monomial class implements all the functions, operators, and properties for representing and operating monomials.~\newline
The Polynomial class implements all the functions, operators, and properties for representing and operating polynomials.~\newline
